# Overview

Anime has always been something that I was really into. So much so that this is the second time I am doing a project with some sort of anime data. I went ahead and decided to work with Pandas in Python. I will admit, it was, and still is, very hard for me to learn. I have been studying the syntax and it just isn't sticking too well, nonetheless, I really think it is cool and I hope I will be able to learn and get better at it. The two things that I was able to do with is is find out the most popular anime genre, and what were the highest rated shows.

# Data Analysis Results

Through my analysis, I found that the most popular genre of anime is comedy. I also found out that the highest rated animes are the ones with the most people watching them.
# Development Environment

I used a lot more than I thought I would for this small sized project. I used the Pandas library, Matplot, Python. I used matplot to show a graphical interface for my data findings and then Pandas and Python to wrangle and analyze my data.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I want to come back and try even more data wrangling with Pandas and maybe even R.
* There are so many more difficult things I could do with Pandas and I hope to make my anime anaylization even better.
* Get everything working.
